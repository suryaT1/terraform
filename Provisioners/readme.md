**Terraform includes the concept of provisioners as a measure of pragmatism, knowing that there are always certain behaviors that cannot be directly represented in Terraform's declarative model**


` Providers are 3 types 

  file    - used for copying files from one location to another location - source to destination
  
  local-exec  - performs actions on local machine
  
  remote-exec - performs actions on remote machine
